# Base thresholds for anomaly detection
thresholds:
  critical: -0.7  # Scores below this are critical anomalies
  high: -0.4      # Scores below this are high-risk anomalies
  medium: -0.2    # Scores below this are medium-risk anomalies
  low: 0.0        # Scores below this are low-risk anomalies
  
# Adjustment parameters
adjustment:
  rate: 0.1       # Rate at which thresholds adapt
  window: 1000    # Number of transactions to consider for adjustments
  min_critical: -0.9  # Minimum value for critical threshold
  max_critical: -0.5  # Maximum value for critical threshold
